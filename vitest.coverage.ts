/**
 * Tier-based coverage targets and per-package ratchet floors for `dkg-v9`.
 *
 * **Targets** (aspirational — from `dkgv10-spec/CRITICALITY_CATEGORIZATION.md`):
 * - TORNADO: ~100% lines / max review
 * - BURA: ≥80% lines
 * - KOSAVA: ≥60% lines
 *
 * **Ratchet** values below are measured floors (2026-04-06). CI fails if coverage
 * drops below them. Raise them over time toward the tier targets; never lower
 * without team agreement.
