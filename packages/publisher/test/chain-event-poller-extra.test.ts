/**
 * ChainEventPoller edge-case coverage (spec §5.1 / §6).
 *
 * NO BLOCKCHAIN MOCKS. Every test uses the real `EVMChainAdapter`
 * wired to the shared Hardhat node spun up by
 * `packages/chain/test/hardhat-global-setup.ts` (port 9546 for publisher).
 * Events are produced by real V10 contract calls
 * (`createOnChainContextGraph` → `ContextGraphCreated` on
 * `ContextGraphStorage`). Block ranges are advanced using real
 * `hardhat_mine` RPC so cursor / MAX_RANGE behaviour is exercised
 * against genuine on-chain block numbers.
 *
 * This file was migrated from the V9 NameClaimed flow (which depended on
 * the now-archived `ContextGraphNameRegistry.createContextGraph` surface)
 * to the V10 `createOnChainContextGraph` path that emits
 * `ContextGraphCreated`. The poller dispatches both NameClaimed and
 * ContextGraphCreated to `onContextGraphCreated`, so this rewire
 * preserves the original behavioural assertions verbatim.
 *
 * This file covers:
 *   - cursor persistence across restart (load + advance)
 *   - load() errors are non-fatal
 *   - head-seed skip for old events when no pending publishes
 *   - early-block events NOT skipped when hasPendingPublishes (scan
 *     must cover the full history — losing them is a durability bug)
 *   - MAX_RANGE (9000-block) capping → multiple polls needed for large gaps
 *   - callback failures must NOT abort the poll (fault isolation)
 *   - double-start() is a no-op (no duplicate timers)
 *   - stop() is idempotent and clears the interval
 *
 * ======================================================================
 * SPEC-GAP SG-6 (carried forward from the original V9 migration):
 *   The real `EVMChainAdapter.listenForEvents()` yields only the event
 *   types the deployed contracts emit (`KCCreated`,
 *   `ContextGraphExpanded`, `ContextGraphCreated`, ...). It does NOT
 *   yield `KnowledgeCollectionUpdated`, `AllowListUpdated`,
 *   `ProfileCreated`, or `ProfileUpdated` even though
 *   `ChainEventPoller.poll()` declares callback slots for all four.
 *   Those four callback paths are dead code in production. A dedicated
 *   regression test below pins this gap so the fix (extending
 *   `listenForEvents` with the missing branches) cannot silently slip.
 * ======================================================================
