/**
 * @title ContextGraphs
 * @notice Stateless logic facade for Context Graph operations. All state lives in
 *         ContextGraphStorage (ERC-721 registry). This contract is replaceable via Hub.
 *
 * @dev The legacy `addBatchToContextGraph` attestation / inclusion-proof
 *      path is REMOVED (closes audit H2). Per-CG hosting committees and
 *      per-CG quorum were removed in SPEC_CG_MEMORY_MODEL: every CG is
 *      hosted by the sharding table at publish time, and the ACK quorum
 *      is the system parameter `parametersStorage.minimumRequiredSignatures()`.
 *      The only per-CG participant list is the EOA allow-list used for
 *      curated / PCA flows.
 *
 *      Publish authorization supports the three curator types encoded in
 *      ContextGraphStorage (see decision #22):
 *
 *        1. EOA    — publishAuthority = wallet, accountId = 0
 *                    Read path: direct address match against stored authority.
 *        2. Safe   — publishAuthority = multisig contract, accountId = 0
 *                    (Safe executes txs as msg.sender, so address equality
 *                    works transparently; ERC-1271 is not required here)
 *        3. PCA    — accountId = DKGPublishingConvictionNFT account id;
 *                    `publishAuthority` is a CREATE-TIME SNAPSHOT only.
 *                    Read path LIVE-RESOLVES `ownerOf(accountId)` and
 *                    accepts that owner or any registered agent of the
 *                    same account. The stored snapshot is IGNORED at read
 *                    time because it goes stale the moment the PCA NFT
 *                    transfers. Governance mutators (participant-agent
 *                    allow-list) similarly live-resolve via
 *                    `_isOwnerOrAuthority`, and agents are NOT granted
 *                    governance rights — only the NFT holder is.
 *                    (Closes Codex HIGH: PCA auth drift on NFT transfer.)
 *
 *      The NFT reference is resolved from the Hub on every authorization
 *      check so that a Phase 6 deployment made *after* the Phase 7 facade
 *      starts working without a facade redeployment.
 *
 *      N17 note: KAV10's current callsite still passes the recovered node
 *      signer wallet into `isAuthorizedPublisher`. That's a Phase 8 fix at
 *      the caller — this facade is responsible for the logic being correct
 *      when a correct principal is supplied.

    /**
     * @notice Check whether `publisher` is authorized to publish to a context graph.
     *
     * @dev Implements the 3-curator-type model per decision #22:
     *
     *      - Open CGs (publishPolicy == 1) allow any non-zero principal.
     *      - Curated + EOA curator (accountId == 0): direct address equality
     *        against the STORED `publishAuthority`. The storage layer auto-
     *        rotates this field when the CG NFT transfers, so it is always
     *        live for EOA/Safe mode.
     *      - Curated + Safe multisig (accountId == 0): same direct address
     *        equality. A Gnosis Safe IS `msg.sender` when it executes a
     *        transaction, so any call made on behalf of the Safe arrives
     *        here with `publisher == safeAddress`. No ERC-1271 signature
     *        check is required at this layer.
     *      - Curated + PCA (accountId != 0): the stored `publishAuthority`
     *        is a CREATE-TIME SNAPSHOT that goes STALE the moment the PCA
     *        NFT transfers. The stored snapshot is therefore IGNORED for
     *        authorization. Instead we LIVE-RESOLVE the current PCA NFT
     *        owner via `IDKGPublishingConvictionNFT.ownerOf(accountId)` and
     *        accept either (a) that live owner directly or (b) a registered
     *        agent whose `agentToAccountId(publisher) == accountId`. Both
     *        mappings on the NFT contract are cleared by the transfer hook,
     *        so stale agent entries automatically stop authorizing.
     *
     *      Branch order is IMPORTANT. Because the EOA/Safe branch matches on
     *      the stored authority snapshot, it MUST NOT run in PCA mode — an
     *      unconditional direct-equality check before the accountId branch
     *      would silently authorize a stale ex-owner. (Closes Codex HIGH
     *      "PCA auth drift on NFT transfer": Alice creates a CG in PCA mode,
     *      transfers the NFT to Bob, and the stored authority still reads
     *      Alice. The pre-fix code returned true for Alice; the fix ignores
     *      the snapshot in PCA mode and live-resolves ownerOf(accountId)
     *      which now returns Bob.)
     *
     *      The DKGPublishingConvictionNFT reference is resolved on every call
     *      via a `try/catch` on `hub.getContractAddress("DKGPublishingConvictionNFT")`.
     *      Hub's `getContractAddress` reverts with `ContractDoesNotExist` when
     *      the contract is not registered (see UnorderedNamedContractDynamicSet.get),
     *      so the catch branch handles gracefully-degraded environments where
     *      Phase 6 has not been deployed yet. Using a fresh lookup each call
     *      (rather than caching on `initialize()`) lets the PCA branch start
     *      working without a facade redeployment once Phase 6 lands. Any
     *      resolution failure in PCA mode yields `false` (fail-closed read
     *      path — unlike the write path, which reverts).
     *
     *      View-only — no state mutations.
     *
     *      N17 note: the external signature intentionally takes the paying
     *      principal as `publisher` rather than the recovered publisher-node
     *      signer. The matching caller-side fix lives in `KnowledgeAssetsV10`
     *      Phase 8 — `_executePublishCore` and `_executeUpdateCore` both pass
     *      `msg.sender` here instead of the recovered node wallet.

     *      prevention guarantee. The stored `publishAuthority` is a
     *      snapshot that this check validates ONCE at write time so the
     *      initial config is internally consistent — "you claimed authority
     *      X owns account Y; we verified X == ownerOf(Y) right now."
     *
     *      Drift AFTER write (e.g. Alice creates a CG in PCA mode, then
     *      transfers the PCA NFT to Bob) is handled by LIVE RESOLVE at
     *      read time in `isAuthorizedPublisher` and `_isOwnerOrAuthority`,
     *      which IGNORE the stored snapshot in PCA mode and dereference
     *      `ownerOf(accountId)` on every call. The stored snapshot is
     *      retained only as a write-time audit trail and is NOT used for
     *      authorization. (Codex HIGH: PCA auth drift on NFT transfer.)
     *
     *      Historical rationale (still valid): the pre-live-resolve design
     *      ORed an EOA/Safe direct-authority branch with a PCA-agent
     *      branch, so a mismatched pair — e.g. `publishAuthority = Alice`,
     *      `accountId = 42` where account 42 is owned by Bob — would have
     *      silently granted TWO curators to the same CG: Alice via the EOA
     *      branch, Bob's agents via the PCA branch. The live-resolve fix
     *      collapses the EOA branch out of PCA mode entirely, but the
     *      write-time coherence check is still valuable because it catches
     *      misconfigurations where the caller passes an authority that
     *      does not match the NFT they claim. Without it, Alice could
     *      create a CG with `(authority = Alice, accountId = Bob's)` and
     *      the initial authorization surface would silently be "whoever
     *      owns Bob's NFT now" rather than the more obvious "Alice". A
     *      clear write-time revert keeps storage honest.
     *
     *      Fail-closed write-path behavior (stricter than read-path):
     *        - If the NFT contract is not resolvable via Hub (not registered,
     *          zero address, or Hub reverts), revert with `PCANotResolvable`.
     *          Unlike `isAuthorizedPublisher`, which gracefully degrades on a
     *          missing NFT, a write path that fails to resolve the NFT must
     *          revert — otherwise it lets a PCA config land without validation.
     *          Callers who want a non-PCA CG must pass accountId == 0 and use
     *          EOA/Safe mode instead.
     *        - If `ownerOf(accountId)` reverts (OZ's ERC721NonexistentToken),
     *          revert with `PCAAccountDoesNotExist`.
     *        - If the ownership check succeeds but the owner doesn't match the
     *          claimed authority, revert with `PCAAuthorityMismatch`.
     *
     *      `accountId == 0` (non-PCA / EOA / Safe / open) skips the check
     *      entirely — EOA/Safe modes use the stored authority verbatim at
     *      read time and there is no PCA lookup to reconcile.
     *
     *      `authority == address(0)` also skips: it represents either the
     *      open-policy state (where non-zero accountId is structurally
     *      rejected by storage with a clear "open policy" message — we
     *      don't want to shadow that with a PCA-specific error) or a
     *      malformed curated state that storage's own zero-authority
     *      guard will reject downstream. Either way, deferring to storage
     *      gives the caller the clearer diagnostic.
